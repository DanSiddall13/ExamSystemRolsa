# ExamSystemRolsa

This is my exam system made for the 2025 Operational Specialism task. 
# The purpose of the system
This system allows users to find out information about green energy, solar panels, EV chargers and HEM's as well as book appointments 
to schedule a booking/consultation for these products. There is also a carbon footprint calculator and an account registration page. 

# How to run the system locally
First install the files from github by pressing code

To run it and view my website use Microsoft Visual Studio which you can download a free community version of from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ 
Ensure this is Visual studio and NOT visual studio code.

After this open the installer and follow the steps given
Then open "RolsaSolution.sln" which is found within RolsaSolutionFinal.
from visual studio you can install a python compiler from inside visual studio and install flask by pressing the yellow present icon on the top bar
. Once all is installed open the project file "RolsaSolution.sln" 
Then you can run the code by pressin Start at the top or "F5" while on app.py . Once the code is running this is what the console should look like.

If it does not look like this and it returns an error then make sure you have downloaded python and installed flask or any other library which it may specify within the error.

If the console does look like that then you can open a browser and go to "http://localhost:5000/" in the search/address bar
This should show the website and allow you to access the code and run it as normal
