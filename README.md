This is my exam system made for the 2025 Operational Specialism task. 
# The purpose of the systemS
This system allows users to find out information about green energy, solar panels, EV chargers and HEM's as well as book appointments 
to schedule a booking/consultation for these products. There is also a carbon footprint calculator and an account registration page. 

# How to run the system locally
First install the files from github by pressing "Code" and then download ZIP.

Once the file is installed unzip it and 

To run it and view my website use Microsoft Visual Studio which you can download a free community version of from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ 
Ensure this is Visual studio and NOT visual studio code.

After this open the installer and follow the steps given
from visual studio you can install a python compiler from inside visual studio
Then open "RolsaSolution.sln" which is found within RolsaSolutionFinal.
It may seem like its opened nothing, but it has opened the solution behind the scenes and won't show it you unless you explictly open app.py.
You can open app.py by pressing "ctrl + o" and then selecting app.py found in RolsaSolutionFinal/app/app.py

Once the present in clicked it should open a new tab on the right which will show a search bar and a list of packages installed. It should look like this

Then in the search bar type "Flask"
The first result should be "pip install flask" press that and it should install flask for you.

Then you can run the code by pressin Start at the top or "F5" while on app.py . Once the code is running this is what the console should look like.

If it does not look like this and it returns an error then make sure you have downloaded python and installed flask or any other library which it may specify within the error.

If the console does look like that then you can open a browser and go to "http://localhost:5000/" in the search/address bar
This should show the website and allow you to access the code and run it as normal
