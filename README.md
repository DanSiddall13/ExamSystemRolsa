# ExamSystemRolsa

This is my exam system made for the 2025 Operational Specialism task. 
To run it and view my website use Microsoft Visual Studio and open the project file "RolsaSolution.sln" 
Then you can run the code. Once the code is running this is what the console should look like.

If it does not look like this and it returns an error then make sure you have downloaded python and installed flask or any other library which it may specify.

If the console does look like that then you can open a browser and go to "http://localhost:5000/" in the search/address bar
This should show the website and allow you to access the code and run it as normal
