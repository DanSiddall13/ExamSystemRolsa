# ExamSystemRolsa

This is my exam system made for the 2025 Operational Specialism task. 
# The purpose of the system
This system allows users to find out information about green energy, solar panels, EV chargers and HEM's as well as book appointments 
to schedule a booking/consultation for these products. There is also a carbon footprint calculator and an account registration page. 

# How to run the system locally
To run it and view my website use Microsoft Visual Studio which you can download a free community version of from microsoft, Once this is done
from visual studio you can install a python compiler and install flask via "pip install flask" in the console or in the packages section identified as a little yellow present on the
 top bar. Once all is installed open the project file "RolsaSolution.sln" 
Then you can run the code by pressin Start at the top or "F5" while on app.py . Once the code is running this is what the console should look like.

If it does not look like this and it returns an error then make sure you have downloaded python and installed flask or any other library which it may specify within the error.

If the console does look like that then you can open a browser and go to "http://localhost:5000/" in the search/address bar
This should show the website and allow you to access the code and run it as normal
